# Biological Molecules Interactive Lab

An educational web application for chemistry students to learn about biological molecules through interactive drag-and-drop molecular building exercises.

## 🧬 About This Lab

This interactive lab teaches students about molecular structures through three progressive procedures:
1. **Simple Molecules** - Basic bond shapes and atom placement
2. **Amino Acids** - Organic molecules and peptide synthesis
3. **Carbohydrates** - Sugar molecules and disaccharide formation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. No installation or build process required - pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
3. Works on desktop and tablet devices

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Students will:
- Identify correct molecular bond shapes
- Place atoms to form molecular structures
- Understand molecular complexity progression
- Build complex molecules through synthesis

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup with accessibility
- **CSS3** - Modern layouts and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No external dependencies
- **SVG** - Scalable molecular graphics
