4. **Synthesis Concepts** - Build larger molecules from smaller components

## üîß Development Notes

### State Management
The application uses a clean class-based architecture with centralized state:
```javascript
class BiologicalMoleculesLab {
    constructor() {
        this.state = {
            currentProcedure: 0,
            currentMolecule: null,
            completedMolecules: new Set(),
            moleculeSteps: new Map()
        };
    }
}
```

### Extensibility
The modular design allows easy addition of:
- New molecular structures
- Additional procedures
- Enhanced feedback systems
- Assessment capabilities

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- CSS-based animations for smooth 60fps
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size
- SVG graphics for scalability
